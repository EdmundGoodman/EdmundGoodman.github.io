## Web design

  - As a result of scrollbar appearing/disappearing
- [x] Switch from bootstrap to tablr icons
- [x] gelato scraper
- [x] Fix linenos in highlight blocks
- [x] Block comments better

- [ ] Add post tags and show in post list
- [ ] Improve gelato (probably submodule markdown out into separate repo?)
  - [ ] Consider moving submodule to not expose raw menus statically?
- [ ] Fix svg icons to re-use from single load rather than many inline
- [ ] Formatting for hook lines and show in post list?
- [ ] Wrap long links on narrow screens
- [ ] Think about splash page lightweight designs
  - monochrome gradient?
- [ ] Look at fonts/colour schemes
- [ ] Tag selector on blog page, defaulting to "best of"?
- [ ] Gwern-style/better typography sidenote admonitions
- [ ] Make all font sizes rem?
- [ ] Choose whether to load shortcode css/js + favicon dependent on whether page type uses it (or better specific page uses it)

Hello there! Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I'm Edmund Goodman, a Computer Science student currently doing my year in
industry as a CAD design verification intern at Apple as part of my studies at
the University of Warwick. In my free time, I enjoy choral singing, rock
climbing, and working on various side projects -- some of which I finish!

Hello there! Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I'm Edmund Goodman, a Computer Science undergraduate going into my 3rd year
at the University of Warwick following my year in industry as a CAD design
verification intern at Apple. In my free time, I enjoy choral singing, rock
climbing, and working on various side projects -- some of which I finish!

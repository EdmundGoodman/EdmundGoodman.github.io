Hello there! Welcome to my corner of the internet.

I'm Edmund Goodman, and I'm currently doing my year in industry as a CAD design verification intern at Apple, away from my BSc in Computer Science at the University of Warwick. In my free time, I enjoy playing the trumpet, rock
climbing, and working on various side projects -- some of which I finish!

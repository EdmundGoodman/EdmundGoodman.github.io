I love Jack's Gelato. Unfortunately, their website's menu sucks. So I fixed it.

<!--more-->

## The techical details

Coming soon...

## Please don't sue me disclaimer

All copyright and intellectual property of the menu belongs to
[Jack's Gelato](https://www.jacksgelato.com/).
I hope that this website might drive more people to buy their ice cream, as it
makes it a bit easier to work out what the flavours are each day.

<!-- Additionally, their website runs no advertising so this is not depriving them of
profit in that respect. -->

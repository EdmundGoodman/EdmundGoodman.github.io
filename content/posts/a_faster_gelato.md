I love Jack's Gelato. Unfortunately, their website's menu sucks.
[So I fixed it.](https://edmundgoodman.co.uk/gelato/)

## Why the existing menu sucks

Coming soon...

## How I made it better

Also coming soon...

## Please don't sue me disclaimer

All copyright and intellectual property of the menu contents belongs to
[Jack's Gelato](https://www.jacksgelato.com/).

I will comply with any requests to take this website down, but I hope it never
comes to that. For me, this is just a fun different way to access the menu,
as it makes it a bit easier/faster to work out what the flavours are each day.

Additionally, their website runs no advertising so this is not depriving them of
profit in that respect.

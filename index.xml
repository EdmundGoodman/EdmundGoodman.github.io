Welcome to my corner of the internet.
I&amp;rsquo;m Edmund Goodman, a Computer Science undergraduate going into my 3rd year at the University of Warwick following my year in industry as a CAD design verification intern at Apple. In my free time, I enjoy choral singing, rock climbing, and working on various side projects &amp;ndash; some of which I finish!</description></item><item><title>Blog Canary</title><link>https://edmundgoodman.github.io/posts/2023/01/blog-canary/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jan 2023 14:12:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edmundgoodman.github.io/posts/2023/01/blog-canary/</guid><description>&lt;p>In 1895, John Scott Haldane proposed bringing warm-blooded animals, most
commonly canaries, into mines to detect high levels of carbon monoxide. This
worked because they would become sick (and stop singing) before the miners did.
Because of this, &amp;ldquo;Canary in a coal mine&amp;rdquo; is commonly used as an idiom for
something which warns people of danger.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This blog post is (in a very convoluted sense) a canary for my website, as it
exercises the elements which can be embedded in a blog post. If I broke
something in the server side rendering it will be messed up here, like a canary
in a coal mine.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello There</title><link>https://edmundgoodman.github.io/posts/2022/07/hello-there/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jul 2022 19:01:24 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://edmundgoodman.github.io/posts/2022/07/hello-there/</guid><description>&lt;p>For quite a while, I&amp;rsquo;ve been &amp;ldquo;working on&amp;rdquo; a personal website, letting perfect be
the enemy of good and having nothing to show for it, but no more!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

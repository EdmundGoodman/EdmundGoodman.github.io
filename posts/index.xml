commonly canaries, into mines to detect high levels of carbon monoxide. This
worked because they would become sick (and stop singing) before the miners did.
Because of this, &amp;ldquo;Canary in a coal mine&amp;rdquo; is commonly used as an idiom for
something which warns people of danger.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This blog post is (in a very convoluted sense) a canary for my website, as it
exercises the elements which can be embedded in a blog post. If I broke
something in the server side rendering it will be messed up here, like a canary
in a coal mine.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello There</title><link>https://edmundgoodman.github.io/posts/2022/07/hello-there/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jul 2022 19:01:24 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://edmundgoodman.github.io/posts/2022/07/hello-there/</guid><description>&lt;p>For quite a while, I&amp;rsquo;ve been &amp;ldquo;working on&amp;rdquo; a personal website, letting perfect be
the enemy of good and having nothing to show for it, but no more!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

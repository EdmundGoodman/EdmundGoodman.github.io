It is also available as a gist.
Specifically, this set of steps fixed the boot process on a HP-Envy laptop running EndeavourOS with an ext4 file system. The issue normally occurs after an interrupted update using pacman -Syu, which then causes the system to be unable to boot after the next restart (showing only &amp;ldquo;boot to firmware interface&amp;rdquo; in the boot menu).</description></item><item><title>Blog Canary</title><link>https://edmundgoodman.github.io/posts/2023/01/blog-canary/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jan 2023 14:12:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://edmundgoodman.github.io/posts/2023/01/blog-canary/</guid><description>&lt;p>In 1895, John Scott Haldane proposed bringing warm-blooded animals, most
commonly canaries, into mines to detect high levels of carbon monoxide. This
worked because they would become sick (and stop singing) before the miners did.
Because of this, &amp;ldquo;Canary in a coal mine&amp;rdquo; is commonly used as an idiom for
something which warns people of danger.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This blog post is (in a very convoluted sense) a canary for my website, as it
exercises the elements which can be embedded in a blog post. If I broke
something in the server side rendering it will be messed up here, like a canary
in a coal mine.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello There</title><link>https://edmundgoodman.github.io/posts/2022/07/hello-there/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jul 2022 19:01:24 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://edmundgoodman.github.io/posts/2022/07/hello-there/</guid><description>&lt;p>For quite a while, I&amp;rsquo;ve been &amp;ldquo;working on&amp;rdquo; a personal website, letting perfect be
the enemy of good and having nothing to show for it, but no more!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
